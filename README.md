# upitt_islandora_solr_search_extras

NOTE:  This module requires a patch to a file in the islandora_solr_search 
module.  The /islandora_solr_search/includes/results.inc needs to be modified 
so that the module_invoke_all call is there.

NOTE:  In order for the search navigation links to appear, several changes need to be made to the site's template and css.  For the template, the additions are simply to put the HTML into page--islandora--object.tpl.php just below the $tags and above the $title render code.

    <?php if ($solr_search_links && (count($solr_search_links)>0)): ?>
    <div class="searchnav">
      <ul class="searchnav-links">
      <?php foreach ($solr_search_links as $solr_search_link) : ?>
        <li><?php print $solr_search_link; ?></li>
      <?php endforeach; ?>
      </ul>
      <br class="clearfloat">
    </div>
    <?php endif; ?>

The CSS additions are:

.searchnav {
  text-align: center;
}
.searchnav-links {
  list-style: none;
  display: inline-block;
}
.searchnav-links li {
  float: left;
  margin: 0 10px;
}

### TODO:
1. Add a page_max_retrieved to the schema for solr_search_sessions and modify the code to look at this value before appending more results to the table.  This will store the actual or calculated page # of search results that is currently stored.  When pulling new solr results, the values between the current page index and the last page_max_retrieved will need to be loaded into the table so that everything stays in order.  This way, there will be no gaps.  If the current page index is 0 and the next click is "last Â»" which takes the user to page 199 (and there are 20 items per page), the solr query will need to get 3,980 records.
